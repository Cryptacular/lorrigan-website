Wells watched from the back of the Clockwerk Cirque’s Big Top, standing in a mess of discarded popcorn he had promised to clean up weeks ago. On the stage, cocooned in light, the strongman and the elephant held the audience captive with feats of strength. Muscles and trunk bulged as weights and clowns were tossed between them.

The crowd was cheering.

They cheered through the sword eater as well. And through the magicians. But those acts weren’t what brought people to the circus. And the signs of impatience were beginning to show.

Through the applause there was a hum caused by shuffling feet and twitching fingers. Not boredom but a tell of what was to come.

Through the four hundred people filling the seats the hum was rising.

Wells slunk back into the shadows and hurried outside.

“Tickets, please,” said the clown at the entrance. He yawned.

“You ask for tickets when they’re going the other way,” said Wells, flipping the clown a rude gesture.

“I haven’t seen it yet,” called the clown. “It ready to go?”

Well shrugged.

“You know what makes worse news for a circus than a bad show, kid? A show that doesn’t go on.”

Wells chose to repeat his earlier gesture as he left the clown guarding the tent.

Well zipped across the field, weaving through the few stragglers who hadn’t secured tickets for the main show. The regs were busying themselves with the smaller acts. The mechanical piano was a big hit as always, waddling between the regs, it’s keys waggling unprompted and music spilling from it.

An eight legged automaton bumped into Wells as it fled a pack of children. It whistled as it passed while popping and coughing popcorn into the air and into eager hands.

Those automatons which weren’t defective or broken sang a song about the circus. Those that were short a few springs but had been rolled out anyway, they shuffled about without purpose. Wells watched them go, knowing full well why they hadn’t been repaired. The same reason that the workshops were running on low grade fuel. The same reason meat and potatoes for dinner had just been potatoes.

Julia’s workshop was near the entrance to the circus, right beneath the banner which read ‘The Amazing Vern and his Flying Clockwork!’. Three other signs, all bright and freshly painted, cried the same nearby. There were another four just like them around the back of the circus. Four more still had been left in the nearby town.

Wells tapped on the door to Julia’s workshop. In lieu of an answer something banged inside. Wells let himself in.

There was a different kind of hum in Julia’s workshop. There was the constant vibrancy of the tools dancing on the walls in time with the shifting melody of the engines and furnace beneath the floor. The hum was off.

Suspended from the ceiling was the phoenix. Beneath it sat Julia,, a portion of the clockwork’s wing in one hand, a spanner in the other. She reached towards one bolt with the spanner, stopped, then reached towards another. She tutted and dropped the spanner. Each bolt remained where it was. Spread all around the clockwork and the clockworker were Julia’s tools.

Enormous eyes looked to Wells through Julia's goggles. "What did he say?" asked Julia.

“He wasn’t very lucid,” said Wells. “Nothing helpful.”

“How lucid, Wells? What did he say?” She smeared grease on her cheeks as she fiddled with the magnification on her goggles.

“Vern said...he said that the knee bone was connected to the thigh bone.”

“Okay, that’s a start. Because I pulled this thing apart three different times and I have nothing. Maybe there’s some kind of propulsion system in the thigh bone. Help me find it.”

Wells didn’t move. “He also said that if I could find the queen and bring her for tea, that would be dandy. He also said he met her once and promised to build her a paper boat to cross the ocean in.”

Julia tapped her spanner on the wing of the clockwork. She blew out her cheeks. “So, really not lucid then?”

“Not a bit. The fever is pretty nasty.”

“What are we going to do?”

“The show has to go on. We promised it.”

Julia blew out her cheeks. “How can we fix him?”

“You’ll have to do it.”

“Me? I’m not a doctor.”

“What good’s a doctor? Just make it fly.”

Julia jabbed her spanner at Wells. “What?”

“The thing. That thing. You can finish it. We promised.”

“He was meant to fix this.”

Wells shrugged. “He’s not going to. They’re saying it was something he ate. Old rice. From a few weeks back that he just found in his workshop.”

Both of them stared at the clockwork creation. The only effort it made to reassure them was to produce a loud whine and then leak unknown fluids onto the tools around it.

Julia wound one of the coils on the clockwork, primed it and waited. The bird lifted one wing, then the other. A soft hum spread through the body.

Then the coil snapped, tore through the wing and speared a hole in the ceiling.

“I’m not wearing enough protection for this,” said Julia. She reached for another coil, recoiled and reached for another. “Vern would know what needs to be done here. I don’t know what any of this is. Not like this.”

“Vern can’t help.”

“I know! I get it. Make yourself useful, go see if Vern made any blueprints. I’m going to need something to help.”

Wells nodded.

“And Vern better hope he doesn’t get better. Or I’m going to kill him for leaving me with this.”

Francis the strongman and his elephant were waiting outside.

“Is it ready yet, Wells?” said Francis. “We drew out our set as much as we could.”

“Sorry,” said Wells. “Not even close.”Francis looked grave.

Wells scooted back across the field, taking a shortcut through the entrance to the Big Top. Centre stage was Rowan. Dressed in black so as to be almost invisible, with a glowing skeleton painted on his clothes, he juggled flaming bones. A quartet of clockwork jugglers tossed similar bones into the air, throwing them to the nearest clockwork or ratcheting up the ante by throwing it to Rowan.

Wells had seen the show enough times to know that Rowan was almost up to his limit. Six batons were in the air above him, not counting the nine or ten that the clockworks were throwing around. His set couldn’t hold the audience’s attention for much longer.

And so Wells hurried on.

Vern’s workshop was quiet, the only sound was a hum from the furnace below. Along each wall the tools were all in their proper places. Not a single one was on the floor. A rather suspect bowl of rice still sat on one of the workbenches. Wells made a mental note to remove it before Vern returned to work.

As he opened and closed Vern’s drawers Wells found himself grateful for the clockworker’s obsessive order. Finding anything in Julia’s workshop would have taken days. A thought which reminded Wells of his time limit.

He discovered the blueprints in a small box at the far end of the bench, next to the foul smelling rice. A quick peek told him nothing more than that the phoenix was meant to be bird shaped, which Wells was positive that it was. He rolled up the paper and stuffed it beneath his arm before setting off back through the Big Top, hoping that Julia would be able to read the plans better than he could.

“Are you ready for the main event?” cried a voice from the stage as Wells entered. He stopped.

The crowd cheered.

Wells raced down and leapt up onto the stage, landing next to the chest of juggling batons. He took a moment to adjust the blueprints under his arm.

The clockworks were no longer juggling, leaving Rowan juggling a full complement of eight batons solo. The clockworks watched in silence, holding their burning batons still.

Wells took two more batons from the chest, lit them using a flame from the nearest clockwork, and held them both for the crowd to see. The crowd roared at the new development. Rowan did not cheer. He carried on juggling.

The skeleton mask shook slightly. Wells hesitated. He had shown the crowd. He had made the promise.

Rowan wobbled as baton moved out of his arc. The crowd gasped. Quick hands kept it from falling. But they were still wobbling.

And Wells tossed in another baton.

A gasp and applause!

Wells smiled and threw a third baton to the juggler. As the crowd cheered louder, Wells felt a warm satisfaction spread across his back. He left the juggler sweating under his new record.

“Tickets please,” said the clown as Wells stepped out of the Big Top.

“You really are a waste of space,” said Wells. The clown gave Wells a rude gesture. Wells hurried on.

He spied the acrobats waiting outside their trailer. “Guys, wind up those arms and legs and take over from Rowan. Slowest routine you like. Just stall.”

“Jesus, Wells!” said the nearest, pointing behind him.

“No arguing!” said Wells and he scurried onwards.

They tried to call after him but Wells didn’t hear them.

Julia was back under the wing when Wells burst into her workshop, his back starting to feel very warm[a].

“It’s late!” said Wells before producing the blueprints, only to find that one end was ever so slightly on fire. Julia lunged for it as Wells tried to bat out the flames.

The blueprints whispered a long plume of smoke at them as Julia and Wells unravelled it. The body of the bird could be plainly seen but the diagrams of the inner workings were lost. Julia blew out her cheeks and adjusted the magnification on her goggles.

“I don’t know how to make it work, Wells,” said Julia. “Here, right here, these bits look a bit like fireworks. But fireworks for show? Fireworks for propulsion? I have no idea. Vern better hope he doesn’t get better or I’m going to kill him[b]. Then I’m going to find a way to use clockwork to reanimate his corpse and I’m going to kill him again.”

Wells was thinking of empty tents abandoned in a field. “Julia, it has to go on. We promised. If it doesn’t...what are we going to do?”

“If I mess with it, Wells, it may very well explode.”

The hum in Julia’s workshop was fading.

“Julia, you can do this. If Vern can, you can.”

“He’s brilliant, Wells.”

“He’s not that brilliant. You know where he is right now? Probably in another fever dream because he was stupid enough to eat that old rice.” Wells picked up a spanner and placed it in Julia’s hand. “I’m going to go back to his workshop, see if I didn’t miss something.”

Back went Wells across the fields, around the back of the Big Top and into Vern’s workshop. It occurred to him then that it may have been easier if they had just kept the clockwork inside and worked on it there. It would also have been better if he hadn’t burnt the blueprints. Or if Vern hadn’t fallen ill. Sighing, he gathered as many loose parts as he could carry, filled his pockets with any screws and bolts that he could find and set off back again.

Wells detoured back through the big top, unsure of what he would find. The hum had grown wild. The crowd was chanting. For a moment looked at the crowd and saw an empty tent. Silent. And he knew that he had to do something.

Quickly Wells slipped around the back of a row and yelled as loudly as he could, “Encore! Encore! Encore!”. He rushed around to another row of seats and yelled it again, then to another and another. Slowly the jeers of the crowd turned into cheers of ‘encore!” and Wells grinned, waving to the panting acrobats as they wound their clockwork limbs[c] up and took to the stage once again.

Wells dumped the excess material on Julia’s workbench. The clockworker instantly snatched several odds and ends. She set to work with a blowtorch, too focused on the task to warn Wells to shield their eyes.

The clockwork was due on stage over an hour ago and still it remained, skeletal and oozing in the workshop, its secrets kept from all but its maker. He wondered if Julia could do it. She was more than capable. She showed just as much promise as her brother. Wells wondered how Vern was.

Something sparked and a plume of fire lanced out from behind a wing.

“I don’t think it’s meant to do that,” said Julia.

“Julia, it’s been an hour, it has to go on.”

“Wells, you’re not helping. Go stall.”

Wells looked to the clockwork creature in pieces on the ground then to Julia. He nodded, and headed back out to the Big Top.

What was once a hum of discomfort had become a roar. There was talk of refunds. Wells stood on the stage before them and wondered if they were right to be so angry. The circus had promised and had failed to deliver. He had bought Julia all the time he could but the clockwork still remained grounded. Something hit Wells in the leg. Something else, harder that time, struck him on the shoulder. He raised his arm to protect his face and remained alone on the stage. Wells thought of an empty tent and shuddered. The circus had to keep going.

A trumpet rolled through the big top. The main doors were flung open. Francis the strongman sat atop the elephant, trumpeting itself blue.

“Ladies and gentlemen!” cried Francis over top of the elephant’s trumpeting. “Easy there, shush. The final event of the Clockwerk Cirque will take place outside! Just follow the elephant! We painted a target on it’s derriere.”

The crowd shuffled outside, their angry hum diluting to a fervour of skepticism and then to the electric buzz of excitement. Wells quickly zipped in between them wondering if Julia had managed it.

He found Julia and the clockwork perched atop her workshop. The clockwork, oblivious to the crowd before it, absently stretched and relaxed its wings. It didn’t look like much.

“Ladies and gentlemen, you’ve all been so patient with us,” said Julia while Wells scrambled up the side of the workshop to join her. “It is our pleasure to share with you our spectacular clockwork phoenix!” As she bent down to wind the clockwork Wells was sure he saw her cross her fingers.

The bird flexed a wing and lay still. Julia wound again. With a sudden jerk of its wings the clockwork launched itself into the air. It swooped low over the crowd, banked hard and climbed into the night sky. The crowd looked on in silence.

“You did it,” breathed Wells. “How did you do it?”

Higher it flew.

“I crammed it full of every kind of propulsion I could find. And every firework we had.”

The bird beat its wings and a plume of fire leapt out from behind it followed by an excited gasp from the audience. Still it climbed higher.

“I don’t think it’s meant to do that,” said Julia.

“Relax,” said Wells. “You did it. It works.”

Higher.

The crowd was silent.

And that was when the clockwork exploded.

The entire bird vanished in a ball of fire, leaving thousands of little sparks raining down in the distance.

There was silence.

Wells looked to Julia then back to the falling remnants of the bird. Julia’s mouth was open. She stared at the glowing metal as they tumbled like stars from the sky.

Wells turned to face the crowd. Stunned faces stared back. Whispers buzzed through the crowd.

Wells thought of an empty circus. And threw his arms up in the air and yelled as loudly as he could, “WOOOH!”

The crowd threw their hands up with him, all yelling their approval at the circus, cheering and clapping the glowing bits of the clockwork as they fell back to the earth.

Julia took a bow, her mouth and eyes still wide.

While she waved to the excited crowd Wells slipped out to mount a clean up crew tand retrieve the exploded parts. Hopefully before anything caught fire.
